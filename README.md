# smallworld_api2
Rewritten version of Matteo Ferla's unofficial python API to SmallWorld (https://github.com/matteoferla/Python_SmallWorld_API)

Please make sure you are allowed to use this interface in the same way that you'd do for Matteo Ferla's API. 

Updates:
 - Callback-driven requests
 - Threading for handling volume search
 - Default 3-attempt retry strategy to tackle the random HTTP 502
